# mcpu_LED
Two LEDs blank on a Altera Demo Board, based on mcpu and verilog.

The original project https://github.com/cpldcpu/MCPU using inout ports to reduce pins, 
these may cause simulaion problems for some software, I rewrite the verilog 
files to avoid inout ports. It had been implemented by a Altera Demo Board that is 
compatible with http://piswords.com/alteraep4ce6e.html
