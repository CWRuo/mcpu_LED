# mcpu_LED
Two LEDs blank on a Altera Demo Board, based on mcpu and verilog.

The original project https://github.com/cpldcpu/MCPU using inout ports to reduce pins, 
these may cause problem for some software during simulaion, so I rewrite the verilog 
files to avoid inout ports, and it's implemented by a Altera Demo Board compatible with
